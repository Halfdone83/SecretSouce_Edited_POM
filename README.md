i pls review the following comments and conduct a fix using pull request

.vs, bin/Debug/net8.0, obj - folders should be removed from source control - they should exist only locally
Please create a separated repository for the current task . Currently I need to checkout all the co0ntent of repo to get access to SecretSoucePageTests_POM folder. On producton this is a must-have  approach - single repo for single solution
Refractor your solution to have 3 projects (not folders in 1 project): Tests, UI, Core and move the appropriate functionality in appropriate projects
BasePageTEsts -> Init of driver - this functionality should be moved into the separated class: WebDriverFactory and should be stored under Core project
 Please review all the syntax issues in solution (empty lines should be removed, intendings, miss spelling etc.)# SecretSouce_Edited_POM
